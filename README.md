**Abstract**:

The **Memory Game with Animated Transitions** is an interactive browser-based application designed to enhance memory and cognitive skills through engaging gameplay. The game consists of a grid of face-down cards, each card having a hidden pair. Players flip two cards at a time, attempting to match them based on memory. If a match is found, the cards remain face-up; if not, they flip back down after a brief delay, allowing players to memorize the cards’ positions.

The application leverages **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to deliver an immersive and visually appealing experience. CSS animations enable smooth card-flipping transitions, while JavaScript handles game logic, including the mechanics of card matching, scoring, and tracking player attempts. A timer and scoring system add an element of challenge, allowing players to improve their memory skills over time. For an enhanced experience, the game can feature multiple difficulty levels and an animated scoring display that rewards players for quick and accurate matches.

In addition, **LocalStorage** is used to save high scores and record the player's best performance, motivating continuous improvement. This project combines fun and function, offering an enjoyable way to boost memory retention through technology-enhanced play.
